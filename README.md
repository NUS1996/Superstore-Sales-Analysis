# Superstore-Sales-Analysis

## Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard is designed to track and analyze key metrics—**Sales**, **Profit**, and **Quantity**—across four regions: **Central**, **East**, **South**, and **West**. The dashboard allows users to filter the data by year and dynamically switch between the three metrics. Additionally, it provides a comparison with the previous year's sales (PY) for the selected year.

## Features

- **Key Metrics**: Track **Sales**, **Profit**, and **Quantity** across four regions: Central, East, South, and West.
- **Year Filter**: Users can filter data by year to view trends and analyze performance for a specific time frame.
- **Dynamic Metric Switch**: Users can toggle between **Sales**, **Profit**, and **Quantity** to visualize different aspects of the business performance.
- **Comparison with Previous Year (PY)**: The dashboard shows a comparison of **Sales** for the selected year versus the previous year (PY).
- **Region Breakdown**: The dashboard displays metrics for each region (Central, East, South, West), allowing users to see regional performance at a glance.

## Requirements

- Power BI Desktop
- Data Source: The dashboard uses a dataset that includes sales, profit, and quantity data for each region and year. (Ensure you have a similar dataset or integrate your own data.)
